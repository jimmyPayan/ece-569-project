# How to run code
UPDATED DOCUMENTATION

From your home directory run the following to import code:
$ git clone https://github.com/jimmyPayan/ece-569-project.git


Change your directory to buildKCF:
$ ece-569-project/final_project/buildKCF

cmake:
$ cmake ../KCF-CUDA/

make:
$ make

Run the code:
$./KCF show
(using show will bring up a stream of where the bounding box is on the images. Code can also be run without this flag)
